Abstract:
Social Networks possess an unique feature known as clustering or community structure which have no underlying universally accepted definition.many authors have propsed many algorithms to detect these facinating structures which have various range of applications from E-Commerce to Criminnolgy.Many algorithms proposed for Community Detection are complex and require high computational power but many have low accuracy and are non-deterministic.This paper proposes an advancement to the newly proposed local algorithm, LCD-SN.The advanced LCD-SN Algorithm gives an iterative approach to calculate the IMP index which is proposed to determine the importance of network nodes using their local characteristics (first- and second-degree neighbors) thus enchancing the accuracy and modularity.Experiments show that improved LCD-SN is effective in identifying communities in social networks with improved accuracy and modularity.
